    This module allows provisioning the WireMock server as a standalone container within your unit test,
    based on [WireMock Docker](https://github.com/wiremock/wiremock-docker).

    WireMock is a popular open-source tool for API mock testing with over 5 million downloads per month.
    It can help you to create stable test and development environments,
    isolate yourself from flakey 3rd parties and simulate APIs that donâ€™t exist yet.
    WireMock has a rich matching system, allowing any part of an incoming request
    to be matched against complex and precise criteria.
